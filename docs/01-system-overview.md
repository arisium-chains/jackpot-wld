# System Overview

## Project Background

**Jackpot WLD** is a production-ready no-loss lottery system built on Worldcoin (WLD) that allows users to deposit WLD tokens, generate yield through configurable adapters, and participate in automated lottery draws funded by the generated yield.

The system implements innovative mechanics where participants never lose their principal investment while still having the opportunity to win prizes from the yield generated by the pooled funds.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **WLD token holders** looking to participate in no-loss lotteries
- **Crypto enthusiasts** interested in yield-generating opportunities with lottery mechanics
- **DeFi users** seeking innovative financial products

### Secondary Users

- **Developers and operators** managing blockchain-based lottery systems
- **Administrators** managing yield generation and prize distribution
- **Auditors and security researchers** analyzing smart contract systems

## Core Problems Solved

### 1. No-Loss Lottery Mechanics

- Enables lottery participation without risk of losing principal
- Users retain their deposits while competing for yield-based prizes
- Eliminates the traditional risk/reward trade-off of conventional lotteries

### 2. Identity Verification Integration

- Integrates real-world identity verification through World ID
- Ensures one-person-one-entry fairness
- Prevents Sybil attacks and multi-account abuse

### 3. Secure Randomness

- Provides cryptographically secure randomness via Chainlink VRF
- Ensures fair and transparent winner selection
- Prevents manipulation of lottery outcomes

### 4. Automated Operations

- Automates lottery draws and yield harvesting
- Reduces operational overhead and human intervention
- Ensures consistent and timely prize distributions

### 5. Comprehensive Observability

- Offers real-time monitoring and error tracking
- Provides detailed transaction history and analytics
- Enables proactive system maintenance and optimization
