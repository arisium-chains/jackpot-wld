## IDENTIFIED RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### LOW RISK
- **Slither Analysis**: Not performed (tool unavailable)
  - *Mitigation*: Manual review completed, recommend external audit

### ACCEPTABLE RISK
- **Gas Costs**: Standard implementation, not optimized
  - *Mitigation*: Monitor gas usage in staging, optimize if needed

### NO CRITICAL RISKS IDENTIFIED

---

## STAGING DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### COMPLETED FOR TESTNET
1. âœ… Deploy contracts to Worldchain Sepolia
2. âœ… Update contract addresses in frontend (addresses.json)
3. âœ… Export contract ABIs to src/abi/ directory
4. âœ… Configure UI for testnet network
5. âœ… Verify network banner displays correctly
6. âœ… Test UI loads pool statistics from deployed contracts
7. âœ… Confirm World ID integration messaging works properly

### RECOMMENDED FOR STAGING
1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Prepare rollback procedures
3. Document operational procedures
4. Set up staging-specific admin keys

## MAINNET READINESS CHECKLIST

### REQUIRED BEFORE MAINNET
- [ ] External security audit by reputable firm
- [ ] Gas optimization review
- [ ] Stress testing with realistic load
- [ ] Multi-signature wallet setup for admin functions
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Insurance coverage evaluation

### RECOMMENDED BEFORE MAINNET
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Formal verification of critical functions
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Legal and compliance review
