## STAGING DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY BEFORE STAGING
1. âœ… Update contract addresses in frontend
2. âœ… Verify all environment configurations
3. âœ… Test network connectivity and RPC endpoints
4. âœ… Confirm World ID integration works on target network

### RECOMMENDED FOR STAGING
1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Prepare rollback procedures
3. Document operational procedures
4. Set up staging-specific admin keys
